# Model overview (work in progress)
A 2-D agent-based model inspired by the Boid model and the Couzin model, which explores the mechanisms of animal collective behaviour. Boids are spawned by default, while predators can be spawned using a button on the interface. 
The goal for the finished model is to have the following functionalities:
- **Graphics mode and data collection mode** -- It can be run with a simple GUI or run without GUI, and instead collect specified data points over a specified number of simulation runs.
- **Option to model environmental gradients** -- such as the depth of drying streams
- **Option to model individual heterogeneity** -- such as boldness and social-proximity
- **Individual movement behaviours and interaction rules with realism**

# How to run the model

## Clone and install
Clone the repository<br>

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

Install in editable mode:
```
pip install -e .
```

## How to run the model in visualization mode
Inside the main directory, run:
```
python temp/run_model_tk.py
```
Or run the following in python:
```
from abmsim.ui_tk import run
run()
```

## How to run the model in simulation & data collection mode
To be updated...
